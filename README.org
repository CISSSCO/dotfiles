#+TITLE: Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: CISSSCO
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Overview
This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files.
It exists so I can version, maintain, and quickly reproduce my working
environment across machines.

Everything here reflects how *I* work day-to-day: shells, editor, window
manager, and desktop setup.

* Structure
High-level layout of the repository:

| Path            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| bash/           | Bash configuration |
| bspwm/          | BSPWM window manager |
| emacs/doom/     | Doom Emacs configuration |
| picom/          | Picom compositor |
| polybar/        | Polybar setup |
| rice/r1/        | Desktop ricing / theming |
| rofi/           | Rofi launcher configuration |
| sxhkd/          | Hotkey bindings |
| vim/            | Vim configuration |
| zsh/            | Zsh configuration |
| .xinitrc        | X session startup |

* Philosophy
- Explicit, minimal, and reproducible
- Modular configs instead of monolithic files
- Version control over ad-hoc tweaks
- No secrets or machine-specific state committed

* Setup
Clone the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/CISSSCO/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
#+END_SRC

Symlink what I need on a given machine (example):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/.xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
#+END_SRC

I intentionally do not use an all-in-one installer. I link only what I
actually want on that system.

* Editing & Updating
I edit configs directly inside this repo, test locally, then commit.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
git commit -am "update polybar layout"
git push
#+END_SRC

* Notes
- Some configs may assume Arch Linux or similar setups.
- Fonts, themes, and system packages are *not* managed here.
- Local overrides (machine-specific tweaks) stay untracked.

This repo is primarily for my own use, but structured cleanly enough to
reuse or adapt elsewhere.
